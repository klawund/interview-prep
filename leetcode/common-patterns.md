# common patterns

## sliding window
when traversing a sequenced data structured (list, array, string), process smaller chunks (the window) at a time, sliding it over progressively

## subset
when searching for all possible combinations of a given set start by creating an empty set and at each level consider all the ways to add the next element to the existing subset to create a new one

## top k elements
using a heap to solve a Kth largest number in a sequenced data structure leverages the underlying sorting algorithm of the heap to identify the Kth largest element

## two pointer
when iterating through an ordered array, using two pointers, going in opposite directions, facilitates solutions fot two sum or three sum
