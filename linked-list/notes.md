# linked list

## what is it

- node-based data structure
- each node points to the next node. if a node doesn't have a next node, it's the list's tail (i.e. last node)
- the first node is called the "head" and the last is the "tail"

## benefits

- compared to an array, linked lists facilitate insertion since its elements aren't (necessarily) stored next to one another in memory, as an array does. by changing node references a new element can be inserted in a linked list without changind other nodes position/data
